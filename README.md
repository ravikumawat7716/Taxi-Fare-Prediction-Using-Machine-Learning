**Taxi Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This repository contains code for building a regression model to predict taxi fares using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and other relevant information.

## Usage

### Google Colab
1. Open `colab_notebook.ipynb`.
2. Click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top.
3. The notebook will open in Google Colab.
4. Run the notebook. It will automatically download the data from the repository and execute the code.

### Local Server or Cloud VM
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravikumawat7716/Taxi-Fare-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd Taxi-Fare-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
   ```
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
4. Run the notebook. The data will be downloaded automatically, and the code will execute smoothly without any additional configuration.
